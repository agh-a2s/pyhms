The Hierarchic Memetic Strategy (HMS) is a stochastic global optimizer designed to tackle highly multimodal problems. It is a composite global optimization strategy consisting of a multi-population evolutionary strategy and some auxiliary methods. The HMS makes use of a dynamically-evolving data structure that provides an organization among the component populations. It is a tree with a fixed maximal height and variable internal node degree. Each component population is governed by a particular optimization engine. This package provides a simple python implementation.
